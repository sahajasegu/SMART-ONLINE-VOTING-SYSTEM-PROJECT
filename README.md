Our country, India is the largest democratic country in the world. India has only offline voting system which is not effective and 
up to the mark as it requires large man force and it also requires more time to process and publish the results. 
The new method does not force the personâ€™s physical appearance to vote.
The face scanning system is used to record the voters face prior to the election and is useful at the time of voting. 
This system also enables the user the citizens to see the results anytime.
